DAILY LOGS CALCULATOR


====================
ISSUES
====================

1. Keeping track of other programming languages:
   - Option 1: Allow users to add custom key–value pairs
     * Requires language key normalization (e.g., JSON vs Json)
     * Export, import, and reporting become complex
   - Option 2: Add a single "Others" field to group all non-core languages

2. Add option to merge daily logs if duplicate dates exist

3. Add a remarks field (if required)

4. Backup and fetch logs from a backend service

6. add user languages for exporting in csv , xlsx and json.



====================
SOLVED
====================

1. Previous totals are calculated only till the selected date when copying stats to clipboard
2. Delete a daily log for a specific date
3. Partially update daily stats
4. Exported files include all-time total along with totals
5. Export daily logs as JSON
6. Import daily logs from JSON when backend backup is unavailable
7. Previous totals and previous inputs are included in JSON export and import
8. Exported files include the date in name.
9. User language values are shown during partial updates
10. Daily totals are recalculated when partially updating values
11. Daily totals are cleared after submitting a log
5. fixed totals in previous totals not calculating user added lanugages.
6. fixed previous totals 0 when screen loads - [used .value for span instead of .textcontent]
