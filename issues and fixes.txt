====================
SOLVED
====================

1. Previous totals are calculated only till the selected date when copying stats to clipboard
2. Delete a daily log for a specific date
3. Partially update daily stats
4. Exported files include all-time total along with totals
5. Export daily logs as JSON
6. Import daily logs from JSON when backend backup is unavailable
7. Previous totals and previous inputs are included in JSON export and import
8. Exported files include the date in name.
9. User language values are shown during partial updates
10. Daily totals are recalculated when partially updating values
11. Daily totals are cleared after submitting a log
12. fixed totals in previous totals not calculating user added lanugages.
13. fixed previous totals 0 when screen loads - [used .value for span instead of .textcontent]
14. added user languages for exporting in csv , xlsx.
15. Added User langugaes with langugae normalization for keys and labels for ui with tracking.
16. Added deleting language functionality if data does not exists in the stats.
17. Added flatpickr and highliting for dates the user has submitted daily logs for.
18. FIXED BUG - todays daily_total getting stored as "" while submitting causing alltimetotal to be a long string of numbers.
19. Rendered user languages when importing data because the user might not have the languagae and partial update might remove the languages .
20. exported userlangugaes and current time as key values- for rendering userlanguages during import.
