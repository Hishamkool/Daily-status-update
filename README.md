## üßæ Project Overview

The **Daily Log Tracker** is a lightweight, browser-based web application designed to help track and manage daily productivity statistics with ease.  
It allows users to log and calculate work-related metrics such as **focus time**, **coding time**, and **lines of code** ‚Äî all without needing any backend or account setup.

Built entirely with JavaScript and local storage, the website provides a simple yet powerful interface for maintaining daily logs, reviewing progress, and exporting data.  
It‚Äôs especially useful for developers or teams who need to **record daily activity, calculate totals, and share formatted updates (e.g., on Slack)**.

The system automatically calculates totals, updates previous data entries, and keeps all logs persistent in the browser. With export, copy, and paste-friendly input features, it streamlines the otherwise repetitive task of daily performance reporting.
